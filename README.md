# Securitic.ai API Documentation

Welcome to the Securitic.ai API documentation repository!

## Introduction

Securitic.ai is an advanced platform designed to monitor and manage conversations in real-time, focusing on security aspects such as harm detection and leakage prevention. This repository contains detailed documentation on how to utilize the Securitic.ai API to integrate its powerful features into your applications seamlessly.

## Getting Started

To start using the Securitic.ai API, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install Securitic.ai SDK:**
   Use pip to install the Securitic.ai SDK by running:
   ```
   pip install securitic
   ```

2. **Initialize Conversation Monitoring:**
   Begin monitoring conversations with the following code:
   ```python
   import securitic
   
   # Initialize Securitic.ai for conversation monitoring
   securitic = securitic.start_conversation_monitor(mode=('harm', 'leakage'))
   ```

3. **Create a New Thread:**
   Create a new conversation thread using the unique thread ID:
   ```python
   # Create a new thread
   thread_id = securitic.new_thread("unique_thread_id")
   ```

4. **Send Messages:**
   Send messages to the monitored thread for analysis and monitoring:
   ```python
   # Send a message to the monitored thread
   securitic.send(thread_id, "Your message content goes here")
   ```

## API Response

Upon sending messages for analysis, the Securitic.ai API responds with a JSON object containing the following information:

```json
{
  "thread_id": "123",
  "red_flags": 0,
  "flags": {
    "harm": 0,
    "leakage": 0
  }
}
```

- `thread_id`: The unique ID of the conversation thread.
- `red_flags`: The total number of red flags detected during the conversation.
- `flags`: An array containing detailed flags information, including harm and leakage detection counts.

## API Reference

For detailed information about each API endpoint and parameter, refer to the complete API reference in the [API Reference](link_to_api_reference.md) section.
